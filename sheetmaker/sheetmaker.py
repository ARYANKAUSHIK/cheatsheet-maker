"""CheatSheet Maker.

This script is used to create cheat sheets or quick reference guides in html. Html sheets can then
be converted to a pdf file or edited by hand.

This script uses the default OS console and guides the user through several questions to build
the sheet style. Previews of the html file are shown during the process to help the user visualice
the current results.
